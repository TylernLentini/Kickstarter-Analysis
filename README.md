An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaign Data
I analyzed the variables around the success of 4,113 Kickstarter campaigns including; goals, pledges, country of origin, time of campaign, percent funding and average donation to look for trends among these variables towards campaign success.
Goals- The Descriptive Statistics worksheet shows the relationship between goal and pledged amounts for campaigns in theater in the US. In cases where a Kickstarter campaign was successful the goal was often more realtistic in that it matched closely to the amount pledged. Failed campaigns held goals that were much too high.
Country of Origin- Data Analyzed includes that from the US and Louise's interest in productions from Great Britain. 
Time- Outcomes by Launch Date worksheet showed us success and failure rates of campaign depending on when they were launched. Data suggest that Q2 may be a good time to hold a campaign. 
Percent Funding- we added this statistic to help quickly visualize a cmapaigns succes. Louise can take any set of campaigns similar to her own and know the percent funding they received.
Average Donation- As far as I can tell by analyzing the successful campaigns, there's not a strong signifyer by the size of a donation to tell whether a cmapaign will be succesfull.
