# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
What are the optimal variables for a successful kickstarter campaign? I analyzed the variables around the outcomes of 4,113 Kickstarter campaigns including; campaign goals, pledges, country of origin, time of campaign, percent funding and average donation to look for trends among these variables in relation to campaign success.
### Purpose
Determine the best set of variables to hold a successful kickstarter campaign. Identify trends based on data and relate those to a practical report.
## Analysis and Challenges
I used Excel to organize and analyze the data, including producing descriptive statistics. 

	Successful 	Failed	
Mean Goal	$5,049	$10,554	
Median Goal	$3,000	$5,000	
Standard Deviation of Goal	$7,749	$21,968	
Upper Quartile of Goal	$5,000	$10,000	
Lower Quartile of Goal	$1,500	$2,000	
IQR of Goal	$3,500	$8,000	
			
Mean Pledged	$5,602	$559	
Median Pledged	$3,168	$103	
Standard Deviation of Pledged	$8,335	$1,331	
Upper Quartile of Pledged	$5,699	$501	
Lower Quartile of Pledged	$1,717	$9	
IQR of Pledged	$3,982	$492	
			
These statistics allow us to judge what is considered 'reasonable ask' in a kickstarter for theater productions.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on launch date, Q2 is the best time to launch a successful campaign. During May campaign success is at its peak when related to launch date.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Based on goals, there are just much more data for low budget shows. More shows means more reliable data. On the surface a show with a budget of 30,000-35,000 seems like a sweet spot, what with its 100% success rate. However, there are only three shows in that budget category to base our analysis and I would say that this is an anomaly of the data. Had we a larger sample size of 30-35k budget shows there would be a greater spread of results. It is likely safer to run a campaign with a budget goal of less than 5k. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Analysis remains my greatest difficulty. Often even after completing the challenges it's difficult to make definite claims. There are always unanswered questions lurking.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	-Q2 is the most optimal time to start a kickstarter campaign for theater shows.
	- December is the worst time for a kickstarter campaign.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	-Overall, goals below 5k have a more reliable data population and produce reassuring results with successful outcomes around 70% of the time.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Sample size is a big challenge. There is more data for shows with low budgets. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
A box plot of the outcomes based on average donation could help us quickly identify the mean, median and mode of donations in successful campaigns. Knowing the average size of a donation in a successful campaign could be key to the success of our own kickstarter.
